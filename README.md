# MetaBorg Contributors [![Contributor Check](https://travis-ci.org/metaborg/contributors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metaborg/contributors)

All contributors to MetaBorg projects must sign and submit a
Contributor License Agreement. This repository contains the text of
the [Individual](Individual-CLA.md) and the
[Corporate](Corporate-CLA.md) Contributor License Agreements. Every
individual committer must submit the Individual CLA. If contributions
are made as part of employment, the employer must additionally submit
a Corporate CLA.

All acknowledged contributors are listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS`
file. To be added as a contributor, you can create a pull request on
this repository, where you add your name and email to the
`CONTRIBUTORS` file. After we receive the appropriate CLA's, we can
add you to the contributor list.

It is possible to automatically verify that all committers to a
repository, both directly and via pull requests, are known
contributors. To enable this, copy `.travis.yml` to the repository,
and enable the repository in [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
