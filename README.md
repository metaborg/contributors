# MetaBorg Contributors [![Contributor Check](https://travis-ci.org/metaborg/contributors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metaborg/contributors)

All contributors to MetaBorg projects must sign and submit a
Contributor License Agreement.

Every individual committer must submit an
[Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://goo.gl/forms/3kGnu0RX2iV4ki612). If
contributions are made as part of employment, the employer must
additionally submit a
[Corporate Contributor License Agreement](http://goo.gl/forms/Dxw8Bed00ODX6lxI2). These
forms can be used to submit the agreements digitally.

All acknowledged contributors are listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS`
file. To be added as a contributor, you can create a pull request on
this repository, where you add your name and email to the
`CONTRIBUTORS` file. After we receive the appropriate agreements, we
add you to the contributor list.

It is possible to automatically verify that all committers to a
repository, both directly and via pull requests, are known
contributors. To enable this, copy `.travis.yml` to the repository,
and enable the repository in [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
